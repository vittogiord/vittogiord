Hi, I was born in Naples, in June 2006. I started studying Computer Science in May 2021.
<br />I have studied from the book "Programmazione in C++" (ISBN 13: 9788838786310).
<br />Currently I am studying from courses 6.042 and 6.006 by MIT OCW. As a support of lectures I use the book "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition", know as CLRS.
